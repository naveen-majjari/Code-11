1. Deadlines and milestones are one of project management process’s ingredients, they act as a guidance line and a signpost of a timely fulfillment and successful application for the given project. Here's why they are important and how they motivate us:

2. Clear Objectives and Focus: Deadlines and milestones, which are usually set in a small span of time, define goals, objectives, and priorities inherent in the project team. Through chunking the work into smaller, possibly doable sections and then of doing it in adherence to the provided deadlines, team members know what they must do and how much time they need. This helps them prioritize tasks and stay on target.

3.Accountability and Responsibility: Teammates become disciplined in their work as they come to understand the critical importance of the deadlines and milestones. Providing the team members with specific tasks until keyboarding deadlines and milestones becomes motivating and help them understand their roles in the team as well as be in time with work. This provides a feeling of oneness of the team member and consequently enhances their dedication to a project.

4. Progress Tracking: Time lines and tentatives goals create an efficient progress monitoring mechanism. Managers can know how far a project has come by continually tracking progress against the predetermined objectives and dates. By spotting any delays or problems in their early stages, problem resolution becomes possible to keep it on schedule.

5. Motivation and Momentum:Enforcing targets and deadlines fosters teamwork and thereby forms among the members a feeling of collecting the rabbits. When everyone knows that there is a schedule to meet then, this situation motivates team members to do their tasks together in a more efficient and goal-oriented manner. When a milestone is reached, it means saluting our efforts, engendering enthusiasm, and making me feel like I can move my project further.

6. Client Expectations and Satisfaction: Deadlines and milestones set standards and make clients aware of promptness of the project. They also redirect on time delivery of the application. Clients are grateful for the transparentness of their progress. They get milestones and timeframes by which they can assess the and even know when they will receive deliverables. Clients are apt to smile when their clothes are steam washed on time, and that has a positive impact on client-cleaners relationship.
